NOTE(irene): this folder contains some empty scripts that function as a replacement for unity's tag system

"Game Object tags are strings and strings are very brittle and error prone. You can easily make a mistake but miscapitalizing a single letter or accidentally adding an invisible space.
So whenever possible you should never use strings in your code. Using a class for a tag means the compile will give you an error if you accidentally mistype the name."
